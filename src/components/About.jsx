              At PJFC, we hold firmly to the timeless truths of the Christian faith as revealed in the Bible. We believe in the authority of Scripture, the Trinity, the deity of Jesus Christ, and the empowering work of the Holy Spirit. We are committed to practising our faith and showing God's love and compassion to those around us. Check our detailed doctrinal statement here (Hyperlink of Statement of Faith).
